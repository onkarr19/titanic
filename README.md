# Titanic: Data Science Project

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The project follows a structured directory organization and includes code for data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and testing. The goal is to provide a comprehensive framework for developing and evaluating machine learning models on the Titanic dataset.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the environment.
3. Download the Titanic dataset and place the files in the `data/raw` directory.
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.
5. Modify the source code files in the `src` directory.
6. Run the tests in the `tests` directory.
